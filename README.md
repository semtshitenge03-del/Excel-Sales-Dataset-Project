# Excel-Sales-Dataset-Project
📊 Excel Data Analysis Project
This project showcases my practice and application of core Excel data-analysis skills using a retail sales dataset.
The dataset includes transaction-level details such as dates, customer demographics, product categories, prices, and total sales.
📁 Dataset Overview
The primary dataset used in this project is retail_sales_dataset, containing fields such as:
Transaction ID
Date / Month / Year
Customer ID
Gender
Generation
Product Category
Quantity
Price per Unit
Total Sales
This dataset allowed practice across calculations, lookup functions, summarization, filtering, and visualisation.

🧮 Functions Practiced
1. SUM
Used to calculate total sales, total quantities sold, and overall revenue.
2. SUMIF
Applied to compute:
Sales by category
Sales by gender
Sales by month
3. AVERAGE
Used to calculate overall average sales and unit prices.
4. AVERAGEIF
Applied to analyze:
Average sales per product category
Average quantity purchased by demographic groups
5. VLOOKUP
Used to:
Match product categories
Pull customer details
Retrieve values across lookup tables
6. Slicers
Implemented slicers for:
Category-level filtering
Year / Month filtering
Gender or generation-based insights
Slicers were embedded into pivot tables and pivot charts to make dynamic dashboards.

📈 Pivot Tables Created
Pivot tables were created to analyse:
Sales by Product Category
Sales by Month / Year
Sales by Gender / Generation
Quantity Sold per Category
Commission analysis (if applicable)
These pivot tables helped identify trends, top-performing categories, and customer segments.

📊 Pivot Charts
Interactive pivot charts added visual insights such as:
Column charts for category sales
Line charts for monthly performance
Bar charts for demographic comparisons
Charts were enhanced with formatting, slicers, and clean color coding.

Low performers
High vs. low quantity purchased
Proper table formatting for readability
Clear header styling
Number formatting for currency and dates
